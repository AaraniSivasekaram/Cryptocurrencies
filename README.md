# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
This challenge had 4 deliverables, where we applied unsupervised learning algorithms to assess cryptocurrencies from trading market data to determine groupings that could help determine future investments.

## Results
- Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA, as seen in table:
